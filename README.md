#Leaflet

This repository contains an R project with three R scripts that illustrate how students of R can engage with spatial data through Leaflet package. 
- The Backgrounds.R illustrates how one might load background tiles (raster background maps) and position one's cursor in them.
- The Hotsprings.R is a script by Ryan Peek of UC Davis (https://ryanpeek.github.io/2017-08-03-converting-XY-data-with-sf-package/) which shows how you can download structured LatLong data from the internet and plot it in R. 
- The Mounds.R script shows how you can take a spreadsheet with X, Y data, convert these into LatLong and visualize on different kinds of background tiles.
